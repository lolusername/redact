## Example

![Example of Redact in action - protest photo with faces automatically redacted](example.jpg)

*Example: A protest photo with faces automatically detected and redacted, protecting participants' identities while preserving the documentation of the event.*

Beyond face detection, Redact automatically strips all metadata from your images. This includes:
- GPS location data
- Device information (camera model, serial number)
- Date and time the photo was taken
- Software used to edit the photo
- Camera settings and technical details
- Thumbnail previews
- Copyright information
- Comments and descriptions

This metadata removal is crucial for privacy, as photos often contain hidden information that could compromise location, timing, and equipment used during documentation.

### Key Features
